  <p>MOON is a responsive digital wallet app that allows users to store multiple financial accounts in one place, customize budgets, schedule transactions, and view expenses reports. The app acts as a secure bank account and transactional card whenever, wherever, making it 'your wallet on the go'.</p>
  <p>It is designed for functionality, with a top focus on security, aiming to assist users to save money while spending regularly. Users will benefit from its realistic budget tips and indicators and minimalistic design. </p>

<h4 id="index.html#projectpage">Role</h4>

  <li>UX/UI Designer</li>
  <li>10 months</li>
  <li>Figma, Marvel, OptimalSort, InVision</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="index.html#projectpage">Problem Statement</h4>

  <p>Users find themselves shopping a lot more online than usual as social restrictions due to the pandemic ceased them from enjoying the liberty to go out, hang out with family and friends, and do any kinds of activities. As a result, users' financial health ends up being out of shape as they could not control their shopping habits and overspend.</p>

<h4 id="index.html#projectpage">Solution</h4>

  <p>A digital solution that can track users' spending to keep them informed of their monthly savings and help them determine what they need to work on to reach their financial goals. Budget customization is one of the many features that can help create good money habits, have a solid financial plan, and reach savings goals.</p>

<h4 id="index.html#projectpage">Overall Process</h4>

  <p>Competitive analyses were first performed to help me spot weaknesses in a competitor’s user experience and to give me insights into what might resonate with users in the market.</p>
  <p>Next, I conducted user research – a survey that received 51 responses, and an interview with 5 participants – to gather information on users’ behavior, motivations, and friction points towards existing products. These early stages helped me define my user personas, which represent two different audience groups, as well as create user flows that outline their goals and expectations.</p>

  <p>Card sorting was done next to better design my information architecture. This method helped me organize the app's information and make it more intuitive. The digital test was conducted through OptimalSort with 8 participants, where my assumptions were either validated or invalidated.</p>
  <p>This is then the part when my Sitemap was refined.  I branched off each page of the app and added the sub-pages, color-coded them to introduce different information hierarchies.</p>

  <p>On to low- to mid-fidelity prototyping, to start fleshing out interaction ideas and forming a flow to my prototypes, I did hand sketching. This method helped me to focus on the high-level functionality of the app while not pondering on other details like spacing and colors.</p>

  <p>Then I’ve transformed these sketches into a clickable prototype.</p>

  <p>During this phase in the project – high-fidelity prototyping – color and UI elements were added to the app's screens, and worked on some alignments, too. Below are images of how some of the app's screens evolved after usability testing and multiple iterations.</p>

<h5>Reducing cognitive overload…</h5>

  <p>Despite the heavy-data content, I made sure that every element in the screen serve a clear purpose to not diminish the visibility of the relevant units of information.</p>

<h5>Making use of the space...</h5>

  <p>To improve the visuals, filling in negative spaces in the design was one of the solutions. This information architecture will provide users with the necessary information within one screen and not overlook any important ones.</p>

<h5>Eliminating unnecessary steps...</h5>

  <p>To shorten the lengthy signup process, I omitted some input fields for a quick and easy flow. Labels and assistive icons were also added to tell users what information is to be entered.</p>

<h4 id="index.html#projectpage">Typography and Color Palettes</h4>

  <p>For my home screen, the font style Lulo Clean is used for the header, while Avenir Light is used for the title to create visual diversity as well as graphic balance. The rest of the pages – Case Study, About, and Contact – uses Playfair Display for the header and Montserrat for paragraph or body to create a good combination that optimizes readability and gives a modern, clean feel to my portfolio.</p>
  <p>The main colors for my website are deep jungle green, a shade of orange-yellow (Crayola), and white. According to a study, deep jungle green can mean being clean, elegant, and accessible. These are all part of my criteria and I want to use colors that are rich and versatile, but not overly colorful. Orange-yellow, on the other hand, is normally associated with feelings of warmth, friendliness, and creativity, which also reflects my personality, and complement perfectly with the deep jungle green.</p>

  <p>Hi! My name is Hanna. I'm a UX/UI Designer with a background in hospitality and an MBA degree. A thrilling transition, but my identity was molded and developed through past experiences that can be valuable in this new career.</p>
  <p>In my daily life, I exercise empathy, understand problems, and improve people's experiences by finding out the best solutions - some of the overlapping skills and traits I possess that are beneficial despite the contrast between industries.</p>
  <p>While I've always been fond of human behavior and technology, there's no doubt this transition will not only allow me to succeed but also thrive. I also pride myself on my strong work ethic, my determination to keep evolving, and my urge to go out of my comfort zone.</p>
  <p>One thing that truly remains compelling about me is the real desire for continuous self-improvement and striving towards reaching goals.</p>
